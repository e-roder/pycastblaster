-move config constants to a separate file?
-make usable on other machines
--rename test.py
--figure out how to make image processing callable from command line
--generate python requirements
--disclaimer about Linux only due to pychromecast networking using poll()
-Move to home assistant server
-try queueing to avoid black screen between images
--maybe just queuing one image and advancing is sufficient? rely on chromecast device to purge queue?
--pychromecast API doesn't support queue management. This would require extending it to do so

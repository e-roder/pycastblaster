TODO:
-curate images
-max_image_height_pixels not in use?
-convert config to dictionary or single global or something to make it easier to use?
-preserve image list progress so that we don't replay the same images
-refresh image list in background thread, swap between iterations? merge (adding new images only) mid-iteration?
-UI/UX: via webserver?
--graceful exit
--reload settings (e.g. slideshow length) on the fly
---or auto-reload settings by scanning config file?
-image processing
--black dividing line between spliced images?
-improve lazy evaluation of is_portait to better handle worst-case scenarios
--treat unknown-layout images like landscape
--don't do lazy evaluation when looking for next portrait image to splice with, just treat like landscape
--pre-evaluate the first 10(?) images so that
--evaluate while waiting for next image instead of sleeping?
-try queueing to avoid black screen between images
--maybe just queuing one image and advancing is sufficient? rely on chromecast device to purge queue?
--pychromecast API doesn't support queue management. This would require extending it to do so

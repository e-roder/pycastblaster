# TODO:
# -set up github
# -image processing
# --bulk processing of images (one-time pass): debug this, images are not being stretched, some are rotated?
# --dynamically compose portait images into temp image
# -currate images: recurrate currated set (some are rotated?)
# -Support for multiple chromecasts?
# --Is this always-on or does it rely on Home Assistant to call it?
# -move config constants to a separate file?
# -Move to home assistant server
# -try queueing to avoid black screen between images
# --pychromecast API doesn't support queue management. This would require extending it to do so
